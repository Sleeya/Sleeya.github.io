                        This investigation’s aims were to map prevalence, normative trends, and patterns of continuity or change
                        in school-based peer victimization throughout formal schooling (i.e., Grades K–12), and determine
                        whether specific victimization patterns (i.e., differential trajectories) were associated with children’s
                        academic performance. A sample of 383 children (193 girls) was followed from kindergarten (Mage
                        5.50) through Grade 12 (Mage  17.89), and measures of peer victimization, school engagement,
                        academic self-perceptions, and achievement were repeatedly administered across this epoch. Although it
                        was the norm for victimization prevalence and frequency to decline across formal schooling, 5 trajectory
                        subtypes were identified, capturing differences in victimization frequency and continuity (i.e., highchronic,
                        moderate-emerging, early victims, low victims, and nonvictims). Consistent with a chronic stress
                        hypothesis, high-chronic victimization consistently was related to lower—and often prolonged—
                        disparities in school engagement, academic self-perceptions, and academic achievement. For other
                        victimization subtypes, movement into victimization (i.e., moderate-emerging) was associated with lower
                        or declining scores on academic indicators, and movement out of victimization (i.e., early victims) with
                        higher or increasing scores on these indicators (i.e., “recovery”). Findings provide a more complete
                        account of the overall prevalence, stability, and developmental course of school-based peer victimization
                        than has been reported to date.
